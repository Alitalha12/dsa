# Intelligent Public Transport Routing & Simulation System (ITRS)

A smart, DSA-based transport simulation system that manages bus routes, handles passengers, and calculates shortest travel paths using advanced Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Features

- **User Management**: Secure login/signup for passengers with admin panel
- **Route Management**: Linked list-based route creation and management
- **Passenger Queue**: Queue data structure for passenger management at stops
- **Ticket System**: Hash table for O(1) ticket verification
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculation
- **Action History**: Stack-based undo/redo operations
- **Real-time Simulation**: Bus movement and passenger flow simulation
